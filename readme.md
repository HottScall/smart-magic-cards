# Smart Magic Cards
Join Smart by performing a simple magic trick.

### Requirements
- Make sure all 4 suits of cards are rendered. There are 13 cards in each suit (‚ô•,   ‚ô£, ‚ô¶, ‚ô†).
- Make sure the value for each card is visible on the initial render, basically move each card a bit so the card is readable.
- Add 3 buttons to the flow that will do 3 actions:
  - **Shuffle:** Randomly shuffles all cards.
  - **Show/Hide:** Hide all the cards by adding a class (CSS is already included).
  - **Magic:** Order the cards again by suit.
- When performing the trick, use the existing cards rather then create new ones.

### User Stories
- As a player I want to be able to be able to see a full deck of cards ordered by number and suit when I press ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get started‚Äù
- As a player I want to be able to shuffle a deck of cards
- As a player I want to be able to turn all cards face down 
- As a player I want to be able to turn a shuffled pack of cards back into their original state



### Flow of User Stories 

<h4 align="center"> As a player I want to be able to be able to see a full deck of cards ordered by number and suit when I press ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get started‚Äù  </h4>

  - Array of numbers and faces
  - Array of suits 
  - Combine both arrays
  - Render the cards to the DOM

<h4 align="center">  As a player I want to be able to shuffle a deck of cards </h4>

 - Player clicks Shuffle 
 - Array is sorted 
 - Take card 1 and card 2 
 - Randomly generate a new card for each 


<h4 align="center"> As a player I want to be able to turn all cards face down </h4>

 - Player clicks Face Down
 - Toggle to the back of the card 
 -  Access Css Element (hidden)
 - Return Css Element (hidden)
 - Change text on button from Card Down to Card Up when flipped (if else statement on the button name)

		
<h4 align="center"> As a player I want to be able to turn a shuffled pack of cards back into their original state </h4>

 - User Click Magic Button 
 - The button takes the current array (gameCard.Deck)
 - Sorts the array by comparing the cards (card1.suit, card2.suit)
 - Then sort cards by Value (card1.value < card2.value)
 - return new array 
 - render new array to the DOM 

#### Bonus points
  - Find a way to remove duplications in the `cards.scss` file and generate all the classes automatically for the cards: `.hearts-1`, `.hearts-2`, ... , `.spades-13`.
  - Add animation.
  - Do not use images for the cards, style them with CSS/SCSS only.
  - Uncomment the tests in the `cypress/integration/magic-trick.js` file and **make sure the tests pass**.
  - Add additional tests (we like test coverage).
  - Add some extra functionality, this is your chance to be creative. üòâ
